The [Installation Guide](https://jamesread.github.io/SpaghettiCannon/install/index.html) has detailed documentation on how to get started, using either docker, or docker compose.

## No Nonsense Open Source

* **No analytics** - of users, or software versions, or tracking of any kind.
* **No company** - there isn't a company backing the project, or with anything to gain, just a small community of enthusiasts doing this in their spare time.
* **No cloud servers** - it will run offline or entirely within a LAN with no problems.
* **No paid extras** - no premium versions, upgrades or "open source core" only.
* **No adverts or tracking cookies** - nobody needs adverts with personal data.
* **No hidden development process** - everything is publicly available on GitHub and Discord.
* **No people excluded** - accessibility is a #1 design consideration.
* **No second thoughts to security** - encryption on by default, quite a lot of automated code scanning being used. Responsible disclosure process in place.
* **Free, Open Source Software** (AGPLv3).
