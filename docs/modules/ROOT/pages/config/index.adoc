= Configuration

All configuration of SpaghettiCannon is via a configuration file called `config.yaml`. When running SpaghettiCannon via Docker, this file is located in the `/config` directory.

The configuration file can be created and edited using any text editor. The configuration file is in YAML format, which is a human-readable data serialization standard.

The most basic `config.yaml` file cam be as simple as this:

.config.yaml
[source,yaml]
