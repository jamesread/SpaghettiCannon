= Support

To get relatively quick access to help, **Discord** is where the chat community for SpaghettiCannon is. Note that this project is a free community open source project, and it relies on volenteers to spare their free time to help you. Please be patient and polite.

If nobody is online, or you're not getting the right level of support, you can raise a ticket with the project's developers on GitHub. Again, please be patient and polite.
